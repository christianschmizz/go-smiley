Smiley Â® Secure Protocol (eSSP, SSP)
====================================

**NOTE**: This is just a pet-project of mine and in no way production ready.

This repository contains an implementation of the Smiley Secure Protocol 
written in Go.

SSP (Smiley Secure Protocol) is a secure interface specifically designed
by Innovative Technology (https://www.innovative-technology.com) to
communicate with cash handling systems.

eSSP (encrypted SSP) adds an encryption layer to SSP using an AES (Advanced
Encryption Standard) algorithm which uses a 128-bit key for an improved
level of security.
