Smiley ® Secure Protocol (eSSP, SSP)
====================================

**NOTE**: This is just a pet-project of mine and in no way production ready.

This repository contains an implementation of the Smiley® Secure Protocol (SPP)
written in Go.

> Smiley ® Secure Protocol (SSP) is a secure interface specifically designed by ITL® to address the problems
experienced by cash handling systems in gaming machines.Problems such as acceptor swapping,
reprogramming acceptors and line tapping areall addressed.

eSSP (encrypted SSP) adds an encryption layer to SSP using an AES (Advanced
Encryption Standard) algorithm which uses a 128-bit key for an improved
level of security.
